Welcome to my Github!

Currently I'm a college student at De Anza/Foothill community colleges and aiming to transfer to a university in fall of 2022.
Here are some of my Computer Science course projects that I have created.

I started out learning python in CIS 40, then took CIS 41A and 35A concurrently. 
Afterwards I took 41B (advanced python) and ended up with an A in the class and have gotten my certificate of achivement in python from De Anza.
After the summer I took 35B (advanced Java) and finished with an A as well. I think that this class is where something finally clicked and I wrote much better code
(as you do with more experience). Everyone starts somewhere and its nice to watch my growth as a programmer, my first works in 41B were okay but they got better over time, and in 35B my professor really got proper coding procedures into my head.

I'm also a huge car enthusiast so I might upload some of my fun projects here too.
