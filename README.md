Welcome to my Github!

Currently I'm a college student at CSULB and aiming to graduate around 2024.
Here are some of my Computer Science course projects that I have created.

I started out learning python in CIS 40, then took CIS 41A and 35A concurrently. 
Afterwards I took 41B (advanced python) and ended up with an A in the class and have gotten my certificate of achivement in python from De Anza.
After the summer I took 35B (advanced Java) and finished with an A as well. I think that this class is where something finally clicked and I wrote much better code
(as you do with more experience). Everyone starts somewhere and its nice to watch my growth as a programmer, my first works in 41B were okay but they got better over time, and in 35B my professor really got proper coding procedures into my head. My final quarter at De Anza, I took the Data Structures/Abstraction course where we focused heavily on creating our own data structures and implementing them with each other without any previous modifications; I earned an A in that course as well.

Currently, I am starting my academic journey at CSULB with large scale OOP application development and more which I am greatly looking forward to. While not busy with school work, I'm hoping to be able to make more progress on some other passion projects of mine which are here as well.
