Hi, I'm not sure how you found my page but this is it!

Currently I'm a college student at De Anza/Foothill community colleges and aiming to transfer to a university soon.
These are all of the CS classes I've taken so far, but if a current student is looking at my work,
just know that I may or may not have hidden some stuff in my work to prevent copying :)

I'm also a huge car enthusiast so I might upload some of my fun projects here too.
