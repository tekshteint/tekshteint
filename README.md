Hi, I'm not sure how you found my page but this is it!

Currently I'm a college student at De Anza/Foothill community colleges and aiming to transfer to a university soon.
These are all of the CS classes I've taken so far, but if a current student is looking at my work,
just know that I may or may not have hidden some stuff in my work to prevent copying :)

I started out learning python in CIS 40, then took CIS 41A and 35A concurrently. 
Afterwards I took 41B (advanced python) and ended up with an A in the class and have gotten my certificate of achivement in python from De Anza.
After the summer I took 35B (advanced Java) and finished with an A as well. I think that this class is where something finally clicked and I wrote much better code
(as you do with more experience). Looking back at my old work makes me cringe and not want it on the internet for the world to see, but this is my page so deal with it :)
Everyone starts somewhere and its nice to watch my growth as a programmer, my first works in 41B were pretty abysmal but they got better over time, and in 35B my professor
really got proper coding procedures into my head.

I'm also a huge car enthusiast so I might upload some of my fun projects here too.
